# EnviroYou
A full-stack local application with a survey that dynamically provides personalized recommendations of local environmental organizations to get involved with. The application icludes a login page to complete the survey. It was created with HTML, CSS, JSON, JS, and PHP. The application was the deliverable of a final project for CSC 220: Advanced Programming Techniques at Smith College. 

With the help of [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/) and [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/), EnviroYou was able to be hosted on a Smith College server. This allowed the PHP files to function on the server side. The application was run on a Windows 10 machine and using Google Chrome as the web browser.
